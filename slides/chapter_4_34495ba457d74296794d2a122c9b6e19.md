## Data analysis

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 32899f8a31
```

`@part1`
- Get to know your data{{1}}

- Little data -> simply look at it{{2}}

- Big data -> ?{{3}}

`@script`
is getting to know your data in the first place. For the Numpy arrays from before, this is pretty easy, because it isn't a lot of data. However, as a data scientist, you'll be crunching thousands, if not millions or billions of numbers.

## City-wide survey

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: df02059657
```

`@part1`
```py
import numpy as np
np_city = ... # Implementation left out
np_city
```

```out
array([[1.64, 71.78],
       [1.37, 63.35],
       [1.6 , 55.09],
       ...,
       [2.04, 74.85],
       [2.04, 68.72],
       [2.01, 73.57]])
```

`@script`
Imagine you conduct a city-wide survey where you ask 5000 adults about their height and weight. You end up with something like this: a 2D numpy array, which I named np_city, that has 5000 rows, corresponding to the 5000 people, and two columns, corresponding to the height and the weight.

Simply staring at these numbers like a zombie won't give you any insights. What you can do, though, is generate summarizing statistics about your data.

## Numpy

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d3c991b91f
code_zoom: 60
```

`@part1`
```py
np.mean(np_city[:,0])
```

```out
1.7472
```

```py
np.median(np_city[:,0])
```

```out
1.75
```

```py
np.corrcoef(np_city[:,0], np_city[:,1])
```

```out
array([[ 1.     , -0.01802],
       [-0.01803,  1.     ]])
```

```py
np.std(np_city[:,0])
```

```out
0.1992
```

- sum(), sort(), ...

- Enforce single data type: speed!

## Generate data

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0c27803967
code_zoom: 80
```

`@part1`
```py
height = np.round(np.random.normal(1.75, 0.20, 5000), 2)

weight = np.round(np.random.normal(60.32, 15, 5000), 2)

np_city = np.column_stack((height, weight))

```
